///////////////////////////////////
///Common Programming Principles///
///////////////////////////////////

/*
DRY = Do not repeat yourself.
KISS = keep it simple, do not make the code too complex.
Avoid creating a YAGNI = do not add what you don't need until you need it
Do the simplest thing that could possibly work = do the simplest work first.
Don't make me think = if you have to fthink too hard when reading the code, it needs to be simplified
Write code for the maintainer = keep the code simple or leave notes for furture maintainers of the code.
Single responsibility principle =  the component of code should perform a single well defined task.
Avoid premature optimization = Donâ€™t even think about optimization unless your code is working
Separation of concerns = Different areas of functionality should be managed by distinct and minimally overlapping modules of code

If any of these concepts are giving me issues. I would have to say it's YAGNI. I feel I'm thinking to far in advance before making sure the simple things are working.
